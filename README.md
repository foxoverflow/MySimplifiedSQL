# MySimplifiedSQL
An easy-to-use PHP class to interact with a SQL database.

I have developed this initially for private use, but later I though it would be worth to share it. I believe it's not coded in the best way possible, but it works pretty well.

Currently the script uses the MySQLi extension (Supports MySQL/MariaDB), support for PDO is one of the main ideas. Unfortunately, I lack the time to do it. Anyway, it is safe and ready for production use. 

See the examples to get started. If you want to handle errors properly make sure to use try/catch statements (Not included in examples).
